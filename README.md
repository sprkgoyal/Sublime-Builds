# Sublime-Builds
To use these builds, first create two files "inputf.in" and "outputf.in" in the same folder where you are gonna save your codes.
"inputf.in" file is used to give inputs to your code and your code prints the output in "outputf.in" file.
Note: type the input in "inputf.in" before compiling the file.
