# Sublime-Builds

Cpp, Python, Java and Kotlin Sublime Builds. These files allow you to run these programs in Sublime seemlessly.

WHERE TO SAVE THESE BUILDS?
ANS: Open Sublime Text -> Tools -> Build System -> New Build System. Copy and Paste my build here and then save.

To use these builds, first create two files "inputf.in" and "outputf.in" in the same folder where you are gonna save your codes.
"inputf.in" file is used to give inputs to your code and your code prints the output in "outputf.in" file.
Note: Put your input in "inputf.in" before compiling the file.
